# JS-functions-closures

The JS engine will execute the code inside of   `createCounter()` when it's called. 
Each time, a new variable counter will be created as well as the declaration of new `increaseCounter()` and `resetCounter()` functions.
Closures are an engineerâ€™s best friend. They allow us to use callbacks and separate our code into public and private access without having to worry that one part of the program will break another part.
